# MinecraftBlocksDistribution
A minecraft mod that samples blocks from the game, intended to be used for data analysis to find the optimal mining strategy


## Notes
Do not use this mod on a server it uses a lot of resources and takes a long time to complete.
This is my first minecraft mod and my first time touching java in a few years...its a little rough around the edges but works. 

## Minecraft Forge
Minecraft Forge was rough to learn... the documentation is almost nonexistent since they constantly change large amounts of the code without changing/updating documentation. The community is also a little rough around the edges. Forum mods are constantly disrespectful in almost all threads answering questions with "Why would you want to do that?" instead of just answering the question making finding answers that cant be found in the outdated documentation brutal. Additonally the community is filled with children making any search a sea of unhelpful questions.
